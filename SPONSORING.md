# Sponsoring the events

This meetup is offered for free to all the Open Source maintainers who want to participate - but, to do so, we could use some help from companies active in this space to ensure that the event is successful 🎩

We want to have one or at max two sponsors per event.

## Sponsoring levels

Sponsorship can be done at two levels:

### 😎"NICE" level

To be a NICE sponsor, you'd have to provide either one of the elements described in the cost breakdown [below](#breakdown-of-costs).

Being a nice sponsor will allow you / your company to have:

- name/logo of the sponsor in the event page (eventbrite & meetup & github)
- logo in the slides that intro the event
- mention by host at the start and at the end of the event
- mention in tweets by the [official account](https://twitter.com/ProvidedAsIs)

### 🤩 "VERY NICE" level

To be a VERY NICE sponsor, you'd have to provide both elements described in the cost breakdown [below](#breakdown-of-costs), or something equivalent (surprise us!).

For being a VERY NICE sponsor, you obtain (on top of everything that NICE sponsors get) the possibility to do a lighting talk to let the participants know how you are involved in Open Source, and why you are awesome!

### Breakdown of costs 💵

Each event will likely have between 20 → 50 participants, and it will need:

#### A) An event space

An event space capable of containing that number of people, with around a couple spaces so that groups can split and have focused discussions → _average/potential cost_: 500£ / 1000£

#### B) Food and refreshments

Something to eat in general - that can accommodate different dietary requirements (ex. vegan) - plus drinks, both alcoholic and non. → _average/potential cost_: 200£ / 600£
